It certainly was nice to not have to sift through all the lines of code for the whole program

command prompt function FC *file name* space *file name* is nice to compare two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the the long term?

help you find mistakes, can help you go back and try a different code path if part of your program doesn't work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
     it nice to break the commits into areas that make logical send to the author and are of a controlled reasonable frequency.  However, automatic commits are nice what if you computer crashes and you have not saved your work for a couple of hours and you lose it all.
